        "Formula 1 is one of the most competitive sports in the world. Engineers and technicians from every team use weather radar screens, provided by Ubimet to the teams, which allows them to track the current weather and make predictions during the race. Race engineers relay precise information to drivers, including:\n",

        "1. How many minutes until it starts raining\n",
        "2. Intensity of the rain\n",
        "3. Which corner will be hit first by the rain\n",
        "4. Duration of the rain\n",
        "5. Points, and even races sometimes, are won and lost based on making sense of what the weather is going to do during a race, and being prepared as a team to act accordingly.\n",

        "Therefore, weather forecasting takes a big part on the possible outcome of a race.\n",

        "You are presented with historical weather data from the RedBull Racing eSports team and you will be required develop an Artificial Intelligence model that is able to make accurate weather predictions / forecasts."
